# Experiment 9 – Reversing an Array Using Pointers

## Aim
To write a C++ program that takes an array of integers as input and displays the array in both original and reversed order using pointers.

## Apparatus Required
- Computer with C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Turbo C++, or any IDE)
- Basic understanding of arrays and pointers

## Theory
An array is a collection of elements stored in contiguous memory locations.  
A pointer stores the address of a variable. In C++, we can use pointers to access array elements and even traverse them in reverse order by manipulating pointer addresses.

## Algorithm
1. Start the program.
2. Declare an integer array of fixed size (e.g., 5 elements).
3. Use a loop to input the array elements from the user.
4. Display the array elements in the order they were entered.
5. Declare a pointer and make it point to the last element of the array.
6. Use a loop to print elements from the last to the first by decreasing the pointer.
7. End the program.
